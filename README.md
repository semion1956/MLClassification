1.	**Download Anaconda**

Anaconda is a free and easy-to-use environment for scientific Python. 

Download from  https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux.  Use installer for Python version >= 3.6.

2.	**Install Anaconda & Python**

See http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux


3.	**Start Anaconda**

http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/

See also http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/

4.	**Create an Anaconda Environment**

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

After creating the new environment, few mashin learning libraries should be installed.

5.	**Install Mashin Learning Libraries**

**TensorFlow** is a tool for machine learning. While it contains a wide range of functionality, TensorFlow is mainly designed for deep neural network models ("deep learning").

For installing TensorFlow, open Terminal to type the following commands.
To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow:

`pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow`

To install the GPU version of TensorFlow:

`pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu`

See https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/

**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow and few other similar tools.
For installing Keras, open Terminal to type the following command:

`pip install keras`

See https://keras.io/#keras-the-python-deep-learning-library.

**Sklearn** is a collection of efficient tools for data analysis and classification. It applies specific machine-learning technique ("shallow learning")  using different algorithms, like SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, etc.
For installing sklearn, open Terminal to type the following command:

`pip install sklearn`

See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/  

**Gensim** is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. 
For installing gensim, open Terminal to type the following command:

`pip install gensim`

See https://pypi.org/project/gensim/

6.  **Jupyter notebook**
Python scripts in this project are presented in Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter is automatically installed for base anaconda environment only. For each new envionment new install (from Navigator or from Teminal, using pip) is required.

Launch notebook from example/notebooks to check, that development environment is set correctly.
